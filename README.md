# hello-world
learning how to share GIS files in GitHub.

I am not a coder, but I have used GIS maps extensively for many years. I have learned about visualization and the many ways in which cartographic tools can help us understand the world.
The challenge with GIS tools for a social scientiest like myself is that learning to use the software involves a steep curve, and even once you have learned to make map views (in my case, created in ArcGIS, QGIS or GeoDA), it is not obvious how to share them.
I hope this is the best way to open my maps for others to improve and use.
